        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                White beans make a fiber-filled swap for gnocchi in this cheesy, indulgent skillet 
                full of white beans, mushrooms, and marinara.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz. mushrooms ($2.29)</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt and pepper ($0.05)</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic ($0.16)</li>
                <li>2 cups marinara (or more to your liking) ($1.00)</li>
                <li>2 15oz. cans butter beans ($2.00)</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp dried basil ($0.05)</li>
                <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper ($0.02)</li>
                <li>4 oz. mozzarella ($0.65)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash and slice the mushrooms. Add the mushrooms, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper to a deep skillet. Sauté the mushrooms until they have wilted and all the moisture in the skillet has evaporated.</li>
                <li>While the mushrooms are sautéing, mince the garlic, drain and rinse the butter beans. Add the garlic to the skillet with the mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes more. </li>
                <li>Add the rinsed butter beans, marinara, basil, and red pepper to the skillet. Stir everything to combine, then allow it to heat through, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>While the skillet is heating through, shred the mozzarella. Top the skillet with the mozzarella, then cover the skillet with foil. Transfer the skillet to the oven* and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.</li>
                <li>Once the cheese has melted, remove the foil, switch the oven to broil, and broil the skillet for a few minutes more to brown the cheese (watch closely, as browning can happen quickly with the broiler). Serve hot, with garlic bread for dipping!</li>
